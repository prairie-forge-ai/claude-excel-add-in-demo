## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is my data safe?
**Yes.** Your spreadsheet data never leaves Excel. We only send the specific cells you select to Claude AI for analysis, and we don't store any of that data on our servers.

### Do I need an Anthropic API key?
**No.** Unlike other AI add-ins, we handle all the AI infrastructure. You just sign up and start using it.

### Can I use this offline?
**No.** Internet connection is required for AI features. However, you can still view previously generated formulas and templates offline.

### What happens after my trial ends?
Your trial ends after 7 days or 50 queries (whichever comes first). You'll see a payment prompt and can upgrade to continue using AI features. Your previously generated formulas and templates remain in your spreadsheet.

### Can I cancel anytime?
**Yes.** Cancel anytime from your account settings. You'll retain access until the end of your current billing period.

### Do you offer refunds?
**Yes.** 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked.

### Can I share my subscription with my team?
**Yes.** Team and Enterprise plans allow multiple users. Each user gets their own account with shared templates and resources.

### What if Claude gives me a wrong formula?
AI isn't perfect! Always test formulas before using them in production. Our Formula Assistant shows you what each formula does so you can verify it. If you find errors, report them and we'll improve the AI.

### Do you support languages other than English?
Currently English only, but we're working on multi-language support. Let us know which languages you'd like to see!
